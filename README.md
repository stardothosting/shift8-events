## Frequently Asked Questions 

### What are the shortcode options? 

An example shortcode would be the following :

<pre>
[shift8-events number="5"]
</pre>

Where "number" is the number of events to pull 

### How can I style the markup? 

The markup that is generated encapsulates everything in a div container with the class "event-container". You can use this class in your CSS to style the feed however you want.

### What else have you done?

We do [web design and development in Toronto](https://www.shift8web.ca "Toronto Web Design")! :)
